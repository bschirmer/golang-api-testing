## Little tidbits
This is the first time I have touched GoLang
Resources used:
https://golang.org/doc/code.html - Go basics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5b64DXeP0o - to get my webserver up and running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQUQ6XQgz8 - to get my head around routes and http verbs
https://medium.com/@edwardpie/parsing-json-request-body-return-json-response-with-golang-c4f862bbb19b - to get my head around getting http body data

## Things I would add if I knew GO better and if I was making this a production application
HTTPS instead of HTTP

## Qustions before submitting
why is log.Fatalf("some string %v", err) what is %v?
What is the arguments on a function, why is it w and r?


## TODO Dev notes
